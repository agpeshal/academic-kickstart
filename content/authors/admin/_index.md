I am a computer science student at Manipal Institute of Technology, India. I am currently in my 4th year. I am interested in deep learning and natural language processing. I am highly motivated to work on building natural language processing systems that understand the world better.

 I love coding and contributing to open-source. I have written code for <a href="https://github.com/chainer/chainer" target="_blank">Chainer</a>, a deep learning library. In my free time, I like playing football and watching movies.
